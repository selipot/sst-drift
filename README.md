# sst-drift
This repository contains the core routine to fit a model of SST temporal evolution to SST observations from surface drifters along their trajectories as described in Elipot et al. 2021 (to be submitted).

The test code is `main.m` which load some test data in `level0_sst_data_drifter_id55366.mat`, run the estimation with the scripts `lowessatx.m` and `ssteval.m`, and plot some results.
